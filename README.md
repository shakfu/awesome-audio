# open-audio

This repo aims to provide a curated guide to open-source audio and music projects.

To be included in this guide, a project must be open-source, maintained, freely available, and subjectively worth including.

As of this writing there are 75 entries in the [yaml database](https://github.com/shakfu/awesome-audio/blob/main/data/entries.yml).

## Status

Currently in a data collection phase.

Entries to the guide are being added to a yaml file: [entries.yml](https://github.com/shakfu/awesome-audio/blob/main/data/entries.yml)

Some of the active projects were taken from the dated [PythonInMusic](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonInMusic) page on python.org. Look into the `research` folder for further info.


## Implementation Process

- Initially markdown or yml data

- Eventually store data in sqlite

- Command line interface to sqlite db for searchable database which can generate search results on-demand to console or html file.

- Also with following features:

  - Generate README.md from sqlite + jinja2 template

  - Check for broken links

  - Get activity stats via apis


## Contributing Entries
